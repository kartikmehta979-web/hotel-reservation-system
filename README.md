# Hotel Reservation System

Java console-based Hotel Reservation System that lets users search, book, cancel, and manage hotel room reservations using OOP and file I/O.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate a simple hotel reservation workflow.  
It allows a user to view available rooms, search by room category, make or cancel reservations, and see booking details stored using Java serialization (file I/O).

## Features

- Room categorization (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) with room numbers and prices.
- Search and list available rooms by category.
- Make reservations by selecting a room and entering guest name.
- Payment simulation step before confirming a booking.
- Cancel existing reservations and free the room again.
- View all current reservations and basic booking details.
- Data persistence using files so rooms and reservations are saved between runs.

## Technologies Used

- Java (console application)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes for `Room`, `Reservation`, and main system)
- File I/O with `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`

## How to Run

1. Compile the program:
